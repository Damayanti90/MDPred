MDPred

Here, we predict drug-GO and drug-pathway associations leading to deriving multifunctionality of drugs. For computational convenience, drugs have been renamed as drug_1, drug_2, etc. Similarly GO ids have been renamed as GO_1, GO_2,etc. Alike pathways, have been renamed as pathway_1, pathway_2, etc.
